ARTIST Repository prototype
===========================

Purpose
-------

The purpose of the ARTIST Repository is to manage the stable artefacts produced in an 
ARTIST migration project. Since ARTIST follows an MDE approach, the artefacts most likely managed 
by the repository are meta-models, UML profiles, as well as model-to-model and model-to-text transformations. 
The focus of the ARTIST repository is to make these more abstract and stable artefacts available via browsing, 
search, a public marketplace and integration into the developer’s Eclipse workspace. The repository is less 
suited to manage model instances or artefacts that change frequently.

The current version of the prototype supports the publishing and retrieval of artefacts, the categorization and tagging 
of artefacts and basic searching capabilities. For artefact storage, a database based on the Java Content Repository (JCR) standard 
is used. The functionality is provided to the user in form of a REST based web service and as a Java-based client API 
that makes integration of the repository services with other ARTIST tools easy. 


Functionality included in this version
--------------------------------------

The following functionality is provided as REST-based web service and Java API client:

- Management (create, read, update, delete, list) of projects (aka dedicated artefact collections)
- Management (create, read, update, delete, list) of artefact metadata and content
- Management (create, read, update, delete, list) of hierarchical categories
- Tagging of artefacts
- Assignment of categories
- Retrieval by structure ({project}/{package}/{artefact})
- Retrieval by category
- Retrieval by tag


Functionality expected in next versions
---------------------------------------

- Security (authentication and authorization)
- Versioning of artefacts
- Extended search capabilities
- Feedback (comments, ratings)


Documentation
-------------

Installation instructions (Section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2), user manual (section 3.3.1) and API documentation 
(appendix A-C) can be found in the ARTIST deliverable D10.3.1 "Repository Prototype" soon to be available 
at http://www.artist-project.eu/documents.


Known issues of this version
----------------------------

- No issues known so far


Project structure
-----------------

All code belonging to the ARTIST Repository is organized under this project. 
You can find the prototype code in the folders

        repo.server : The server including database, service and web service layers
        repo.common : The domain model and service interfaces shared between client and server
        repo.client : The API client that hides the web service calls from users of the Java service API
  

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Prerequisites for building the software:

- Java JDK 1.7
- Apache Maven 3.0.5 or higher

To build to project, issue the following command from the "repository" folder:

		mvn install -DskipTests

To run the tests, issue the following command from the "repository" folder:
