SSL Client
==========

Purpose
-------

This project contains a small REST client that can talk to remote services via SSL/HTTPS. The client
has a regular mode that checks the server certificate against a local key- and truststore and a mode
that omits this check.

The configuration can be found in the 'repo.config' project.
